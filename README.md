# ftp_project

The script for calculating the occupied space on the FTP disk.

Simply overwrite the username, password and hostname in the script. The script will calculate the volume of your files.

This is important: there should be no spaces in the folder names, otherwise the folder with spaces in the name will not be taken into account.
